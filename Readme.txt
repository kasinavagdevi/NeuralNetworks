Dataset:
We have taken the dataset from the data repository below called Iris. The dataset has 150 instance which tells about iris plant species depending on the sepal and petal length, width. This dataset is modeled using neuralNet.
Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris


How to compile
Unzip the file, open the NeuralNet.py file and compile using any python editor preferably python 3, we have used PyCharm. Note: python has to be installed in system
• There are two datasets in the folder which are train and test data divided by 75:25.
• Make sure all the files in the NeuralNet Folder that was submitted.

This has two parts, Part-1 questions are submitted in the NeuralNetDocument.
